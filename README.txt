This package combines [https://github.com/seantis/seantis.dir.base](seantis.dir.base)
with [https://github.com/seantis/seantis.reservation](seantis.reservation) to
provide a two level directory of reservable entities: Facilities (e.g. buildings)
are used to group items (e.g. rooms) than can be reserved online.
